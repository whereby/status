<h1>Whereby status</h1>
<p>We're up, our status page provider isn't though. There is a big outage in Amazon Web Pages, and we're monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>Our subscription management relies on a third party which is currently down, so new signups to paid services might be impacted while the AWS outage is ongoing.</p>
